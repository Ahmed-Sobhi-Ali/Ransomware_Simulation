- **Generating Key**: `generate_key()`
  - Utilizes the Fernet library to generate a unique encryption key securely. Encryption keys are crucial in ransomware operations as they are used to encrypt victims' files, making them inaccessible without the key.

- **Sending the Key to the Hacker**: `send_file(filename, host='192.168.124.52', port=4444)`
  - Establishes a socket connection to a predefined host and port (default values provided) and sends the encryption key file. This mimics the behavior of real ransomware, which often sends the encryption key to the attacker's server for later decryption of files upon payment.

- **Encryption Function**: `encrypt_files(key)`
  - Iterates through each file in the target folder, encrypts its contents using the provided encryption key, and saves the encrypted data back to the original file. This function simulates the core behavior of ransomware, which encrypts victims' files to render them inaccessible without the decryption key.

- **Decryption Function**: `decrypt_files(key)`
  - Performs the reverse operation of encryption by decrypting each encrypted file using the encryption key. This function is crucial for demonstrating the decryption process that occurs after the ransom is paid.

- **Persistence Mechanism**: `create_persistence()`
  - Ensures the ransomware script is executed automatically upon system startup by adding it to the list of startup programs. Persistence is a common technique employed by ransomware to maintain its presence on infected systems, ensuring continued encryption of new files.

- **Network Propagation**: `propagate()`
  - Copies the ransomware script to available network shares, facilitating its spread across a network. Network propagation enhances the ransomware's reach and impact by infecting multiple systems within the network.

- **Find Network Shares**: `find_network_shares()`
  - Searches for accessible network shares within the local network environment. This function enables the ransomware to identify potential targets for propagation, replicating the behavior of real-world ransomware that seeks to infect network-connected devices.

- **Scan Network**: `scan_network(ip)`
  - Scans a specified IP range for SMB (Server Message Block) shares on Linux systems. SMB shares are commonly used for file and printer sharing on networks, making them attractive targets for ransomware propagation.

- **Leave Ransom Note**: `leave_ransom_note()`
  - Creates a text file containing the ransom note and saves it in the directory containing the encrypted files. The ransom note informs victims about the encryption, payment instructions, and consequences of non-compliance, mirroring the tactics employed by actual ransomware.

- **Anti-Debugging and Anti-VM Techniques**: `anti_debug()`
  - Implements various techniques to detect debugging environments and virtualized systems, making it harder for analysts to analyze the ransomware's behavior. These techniques include checks for debugger presence, common debugger tools, VM artifacts, and timing anomalies.

- **Multi-Threading Function**: `run_in_threads(functions)`
  - Executes multiple functions concurrently using threading, improving the efficiency and responsiveness of the ransomware simulation. Multi-threading allows the ransomware to perform tasks such as encryption, persistence, and network propagation simultaneously, mimicking real-world ransomware behavior.

- **Main Function**: `main()`
  - Serves as the entry point for the ransomware simulation, orchestrating the execution of key generation, encryption, persistence, network propagation, anti-debugging checks, and other essential operations. The main function encapsulates the entire ransomware workflow, providing a cohesive and structured approach to simulating ransomware behavior.
