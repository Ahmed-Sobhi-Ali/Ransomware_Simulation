# Advanced Ransomware Simulation

**Note: This project is for educational purposes only. Running this code can cause permanent data loss. Use it responsibly in a controlled and isolated environment, such as a virtual machine.**

## Overview

This repository contains an advanced implementation of a ransomware simulation script. The purpose of this project is to educate cybersecurity professionals about the inner workings of ransomware, including its encryption techniques, propagation methods, anti-debugging measures, and more.

**Disclaimer**: The author is not responsible for any damages caused by the misuse of this code.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Utilizes the Fernet library to encrypt files in a specified directory using a unique encryption key.
- **Persistence**: Ensures the ransomware script runs automatically upon system startup by adding it to the list of startup programs.
- **Network Propagation**: Copies the ransomware script to available network shares, facilitating its spread across a network.
- **Anti-Debugging and Anti-VM Techniques**: Implements various techniques to detect debugging environments and virtualized systems, making analysis more challenging.
- **Multi-Threading**: Executes multiple functions concurrently using threading, enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of the ransomware simulation.
- **Ransom Note Generation**: Creates a ransom note file containing instructions for victims, including payment details and warnings.

## Usage

1. **Setup Environment**: Run the code in a controlled and isolated environment, such as a virtual machine, to prevent unintended damage to real data.
2. **Configuration**: Update the paths and settings in the script according to your environment and preferences.
3. **Execution**: Run the main script to initiate the ransomware simulation. Ensure that you have necessary permissions to execute the script and access the specified directories.
4. **Simulation**: Observe the behavior of the ransomware simulation, including encryption of files, propagation across network shares, and generation of a ransom note.
5. **Analysis and Learning**: Use the simulation to study ransomware behavior, understand defense mechanisms, and enhance cybersecurity skills.
